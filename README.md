I followed the instructions here https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/25.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide

I downloaded this binary for linux https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/test.rc2/bitcoin-25.0rc2-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz

My machine is System76 Gazelle running Pop!OS 22.04 LTS.

I was able to get the expected results for all test save for a few minor what I presume to be typos in guide.
